# Tracking Branches

Currently all work twoards the *alpha* ISO goes in a tracking branch alpha_iso.

Developers should clone this branch and push all alpha work to it.

Eventually it will merge into a yet non-existent beta_iso branch and then into 
master when work gets that far.

Remember to push all work on alpha_iso so other developers can *see* the work.
